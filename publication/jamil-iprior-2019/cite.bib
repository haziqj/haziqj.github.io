 abstract = {This is an overview of the R package iprior, which implements a unified methodology for fitting parametric and nonparametric regression models, including additive models, multilevel models, and models with one or more functional covariates. Based on the principle of maximum entropy, an I-prior is an objective Gaussian process prior for the regression function with covariance kernel equal to its Fisher information. The regression function is estimated by its posterior mean under the I-prior, and hyperparameters are estimated via maximum marginal likelihood. Estimation of I-prior models is simple and inference straightforward, while small and large sample predictive performances are comparative, and often better, to similar leading state-of-the-art models. We illustrate the use of the iprior package by analysing a simulated toy data set as well as three real-data examples, in particular, a multilevel data set, a longitudinal data set, and a dataset involving a functional covariate.},
