  abstract = {We introduce the I-prior methodology as a unifying framework for estimating a variety of regression models, including varying coefficient, multilevel, longitudinal models, and models with functional covariates and responses. It can also be used for multi-class classification, with low or high dimensional covariates. The I-prior is generally defined as a maximum entropy prior. For a regression function, the I-prior is Gaussian with covariance kernel proportional to the Fisher information on the regression function, which is estimated by its posterior distribution under the I-prior. The I-prior has the intuitively appealing property that the more information is available on a linear functional of the regression function, the larger the prior variance, and the smaller the influence of the prior mean on the posterior distribution. Advantages compared to competing methods, such as Gaussian process regression or Tikhonov regularization, are ease of estimation and model comparison. In particular, we develop an EM algorithm with a simple E and M step for estimating hyperparameters, facilitating estimation for complex models. We also propose a novel parsimonious model formulation, requiring a single scale parameter for each (possibly multidimensional) covariate and no further parameters for interaction effects. This simplifies estimation because fewer hyperparameters need to be estimated, and also simplifies model comparison of models with the same covariates but different interaction effects; in this case, the model with the highest estimated likelihood can be selected. Using a number of widely analyzed real data sets we show that predictive performance of our methodology is competitive. An R-package implementing the methodology is available (Jamil, 2019).},

@InCollection{jamil_advocating_2022,
  abstract = {Institutional mathematics education has long been traditional in its ways of being teacher-centric, a tradition which perhaps dates back to the Ancient Greece. Much like the society in those days, where there was a wary public feeling about the rigidness of the mathematical instruction in Pythagoras' school, mathematics educators find themselves in a similar position in the common era of 2020. Unlike the Ancient Greece however, the battle is for the sustained delivery of a comprehensive mathematics education in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. It would be fair to say that mathematics departments across all levels of the education sector have been affected drastically; more so on instructors who favour the traditional ``chalk and talk'' method of instruction. In this article, we share several lessons learned in the delivery of mathematical instruction at undergraduate university level during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on our experience at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. These include specific methods for implementing online learning effectively, the pros and cons of such methods, and how we can use computer based tools to make learning more conducive. We highly think that these implementations are beneficial to be adapted by mathematics departments anywhere as a means of adapting to the new realities post Covid-19.},

@InCollection{jamil_bayesian_2021,
  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to modelling differs from the frequentist approach primarily in the supplementation of additional information about the parameters to the data. If we specify a ``good'' prior, in the sense that the prior nudges the likelihood in the right direction, then the estimates will also be good. This is what we aim to do in the case of variable selection problems, whereby the Bayesian method reduces the selection problem to one of estimation from a true search of the variable space for the model which optimises a certain criterion. We contribute to the vastly available literature of variable selection methods by using I-priors [5]---a class of Gaussian distributions which has the distinguishing property of having covariance proportional to the Fisher information (of the model parameters). The original motivation behind the I-prior methodology was to develop a novel unifying approach to various regression models. In this work, we detail the I-prior model used, and showcase some simulation results and several real-world applications in which the I-prior performs favourably compared to other prior distributions and/or variable selection techniques in terms of model size, $R^2$, predictive ability, and so on.},

@Article{jamil_iprior_2019,
  abstract = {This is an overview of the R package iprior, which implements a unified methodology for fitting parametric and nonparametric regression models, including additive models, multilevel models, and models with one or more functional covariates. Based on the principle of maximum entropy, an I-prior is an objective Gaussian process prior for the regression function with covariance kernel equal to its Fisher information. The regression function is estimated by its posterior mean under the I-prior, and hyperparameters are estimated via maximum marginal likelihood. Estimation of I-prior models is simple and inference straightforward, while small and large sample predictive performances are comparative, and often better, to similar leading state-of-the-art models. We illustrate the use of the iprior package by analysing a simulated toy data set as well as three real-data examples, in particular, a multilevel data set, a longitudinal data set, and a dataset involving a functional covariate.},

  abstract = {Methods for the treatment of item non-response in attitudinal scales and in large-scale assessments under the pairwise likelihood (PL) estimation framework and under a missing at random (MAR) mechanism are proposed. Under a full information likelihood estimation framework and MAR, ignorability of the missing data mechanism does not lead to biased estimates. However, this is not the case for pseudo-likelihood approaches such as the PL. We develop and study the performance of three strategies for incorporating missing values into confirmatory factor analysis under the PL framework, the complete-pairs (CP), the available-cases (AC) and the doubly robust (DR) approaches. The CP and AC require only a model for the observed data and standard errors are easy to compute. Doubly-robust versions of the PL estimation require a predictive model for the missing responses given the observed ones and are computationally more demanding than the AC and CP. A simulation study is used to compare the proposed methods. The proposed methods are employed to analyze the UK data on numeracy and literacy collected as part of the OECD Survey of Adult Skills.},

@Article{koukounari_latent_2021,
  abstract = {Various global health initiatives are currently advocating the elimination of schistosomiasis within the next decade. Schistosomiasis is a highly debilitating tropical infectious disease with severe burden of morbidity and thus operational research accurately evaluating diagnostics that quantify the epidemic status for guiding effective strategies is essential. Latent class models (LCMs) have been generally considered in epidemiology and in particular in recent schistosomiasis diagnostic studies as a flexible tool for evaluating diagnostics because assessing the true infection status (via a gold standard) is not possible. However, within the biostatistics literature, classical LCM have already been criticised for real-life problems under violation of the conditional independence (CI) assumption and when applied to a small number of diagnostics (i.e. most often 3-5 diagnostic tests). Solutions of relaxing the CI assumption and accounting for zero-inflation, as well as collecting partial gold standard information, have been proposed, offering the potential for more robust model estimates. In the current article, we examined such approaches in the context of schistosomiasis via analysis of two real datasets and extensive simulation studies. Our main conclusions highlighted poor model fit in low prevalence settings and the necessity of collecting partial gold standard information in such settings in order to improve the accuracy and reduce bias of sensitivity and specificity estimates.},
