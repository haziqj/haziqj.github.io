  abstract = {This paper presents the first spatio-temporal analysis of
    property prices in Brunei Darussalam, a small, resource-rich economy
    with distinct housing market characteristics. Despite global
    interest in quantitative housing market analyses, Brunei’s market
    remains underexplored, with prior studies predominantly qualitative.
    Addressing this gap, \$N=3,763\$ residential transactions from 2015
    to 2023 were analysed using Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) priors
    to model spatial dependencies and temporal trends in house prices
    accounting for other price determinants. Emerging Hotspot Analysis
    was then employed to classify price clustering across time. Key
    findings revealed significant spatial autocorrelation
    (\$\textbackslash rho = 0.43\$) and temporal persistence best
    modeled by an autoregressive structure of order two, indicating that
    market reactions to changes can extend up to six months. The results
    demonstrate the critical role of spatial and temporal factors in
    shaping property prices, providing actionable insights for policy
    interventions and real estate market analysis, particularly in
    addressing disparities between urban and rural housing markets.}
