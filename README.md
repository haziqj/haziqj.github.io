# My personal website

![render bookdown](https://github.com/haziqj/hj-site/actions/workflows/github_pages.yml/badge.svg)

This repo hosts the Hugo built website files deployed from the (private) source repo `hj-site`. It is built automatically using GitHub Actions. 
This workflow was inspired by Michael Schlottke-Lakemper's [blogpost](https://lakemper.eu/blog/getting-started-with-hugo-academic-and-github-pages/) on the subject.  
The theme used is Wowchemy's [Academic template](https://academic-demo.netlify.app).
I've also used the custom domain name `haziqj.ml` for my GitHub pages, so that all project sites will begin with this custom domain (instead of `haziqj.github.io`, although both redirect to the same sites).
