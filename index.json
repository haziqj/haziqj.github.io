For example, soldiers are expected to communicate effectively with each other, operate specialised equipment, and maintain overall situational awareness--often while carrying a heavy load. From a planning and doctrine perspective, it is important for commanders to understand the relationship between load carriage and soldiers‚Äô performance. Such information could help provide recommendations in advising future policies on training, operational safety, and future soldier systems requirements. To this end, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF) conducted controlled experiments and collected numerous measurements intended to capture key soldier performance parameters. The structure of the data set provided several interesting challenges, namely 1) how do we define ‚Äúperformance‚Äù?; 2) how do we appropriately take into account the longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measurements)?; and 3) how do we handle non-ignorable dropouts? We propose a structural equation model to quantify a latent variable representing soldiers' abilities, while taking into consideration the non-random nature of the dropouts and time-varying effects. The main output of the study is to quantify the relationship between load carried versus performance. Additionally, modelling the dropouts allow us to also determine ‚Äúexpected time to exhaustion‚Äù for a given load carried by a soldier.","tags":["Latent Variable Models","Structural Equation Models"],"title":"Investigating the effect of load carriage on soldiers‚Äô performances using structural equation models","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"1cda19dd8843ec96b438455bdcdcd736","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/stat-tables/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stat-tables/","section":"project","summary":"An open source PDF format of statistical tables for use in examinations, tests, assignments, and so on.","tags":["Statistical Tables","Misc"],"title":"Statistical Tables","type":"project"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573653600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"af988344b8d94a14a102df14b3a13841","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/talk/bayesian-variable-selection-for-linear-models/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bayesian-variable-selection-for-linear-models/","section":"event","summary":"In statistical modelling, there is often a genuine interest to learn the most reasonable, parsimonious, and interpretable model that fits the data.

We also discuss an associated R-package called iprior. An I-prior is an objective prior for the regression function, and is based on its Fisher information. The regression function is estimated by its posterior mean under the I-prior, and scale parameters are estimated via maximum marginal likelihood using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Regression modelling using I-priors has several attractive features: it requires no assumptions other than those pertaining to the model of interest; estimation and inference is relatively straightforward; and small and large sample performance can be better than Tikhonov regularization. We illustrate the use of the iprior package by analysing three well- known data sets, in particular, a multilevel data set, a longitudinal data set, and a dataset involving a functional covariate.","tags":["I-prior"],"title":"Regression Modelling with I-Priors","type":"event"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

My talk is a collection of ideas and methods that I picked up along the way in researching my work, in the hopes that it might be of interest and some use in the areas you are working on: 1) Estimation of I-prior models using likelihood methods; 2) The R/iprior package for fitting I-prior models; 3) Shrinkage properties of I-priors and how they link to L2 penalties with individual shrinkage parameters (and equivalently, individual variance hyper-parameters in a Bayesian setting); 4) Estimation of I-prior models in a fully-Bayes setting, with particular interest in the scale parameters; 5) Using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to obtain better quality MCMC chains for the Bayesian I-prior model. I will also share some information on useful tools and software for reproducible research that I came across during my work, including Shiny apps, GitHub, RStudio (for package development), knitr, and Stan.","tags":["Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"],"title":"I-priors in Bayesian Variable Selection: From Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I created two shiny apps to explain Hamiltonian Monte Carlo:\n https://haziqj.shinyapps.io/hmc1/ https://haziqj.shinyapps.io/hmc2/  ","date":1478131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"2e5915e2e78f01b515b4f3a17a935081","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/hmc-shiny/","publishdate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hmc-shiny/","section":"project","summary":"Shiny apps for explaining Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.","tags":["Hamiltonian Monte Carlo","Misc"],"title":"Hamiltonian Monte Carlo explainer","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"b8ee8da5d3f33ba85e78127cab1e2919","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/r-ipriorbvs/","publishdate":"2016-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/r-ipriorbvs/","section":"project","summary":"Bayesian Variable Selection for Linear Models using I-priors in `R`.","tags":["PhD","R Package","I-prior","JAGS"],"title":"R/ipriorBVS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1471564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"b2156151337be53d98c41dfb46d06421","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/r-iprior/","publishdate":"2016-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/r-iprior/","section":"project","summary":"An `R` package for I-prior regression.","tags":["I-prior","PhD","R Package"],"title":"R/iprior","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"0ceb55b6bb1e4423e3ee202ab0b10ece","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/my-phd/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/my-phd/","section":"project","summary":"Regression modelling using priors with Fisher information covariance kernels (I-priors).","tags":["PhD","I-prior"],"title":"My PhD Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1447849800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"d01f338f95937b65766443019a42b618","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/talk/two-stage-bayesian-variable-selection-for-linear-models-using-i-priors/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/two-stage-bayesian-variable-selection-for-linear-models-using-i-priors/","section":"event","summary":"In a previous work, I showed that the use of I-priors in various linear models can be considered as a solution to the over-fitting problem. In that work, estimation was still done using maximum likelihood, so in a sense it was a kind of frequentist-Bayes approach. Switching over to a fully Bayesian framework, we now look at the problem of variable selection, specifically in an ordinary linear regression setting. The appeal of Bayesian methods are that it reduces the selection problem to one of estimation, rather than a true search of the variable space for the model that optimises a certain criterion. I will talk about several Bayesian variable selection methods out there in the literature, and how we can make use of I-priors to improve on results in the presence of multicollinearity.","tags":["PhD","I-prior","Bayesian Variable Selection"],"title":"Two-stage Bayesian variable selection for linear models using I-priors","type":"event"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1432036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630914549,"objectID":"f33f9c2ea2696966d8286ac31a1520b2","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/talk/regression-modelling-using-i-priors/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/regression-modelling-using-i-priors/","section":"event","summary":"The I-prior methodology is a new modelling technique which aims to improve on maximum likelihood estimation of linear models when the dimensionality is large relative to the sample size. By putting a prior which is informed by the dataset (as opposed to a subjective prior), advantages such as model parsimony, lesser model assumptions, simpler estimation, and simpler hypothesis testing can be had. By way of introducing the I-prior methodology, we will give examples of linear models estimated using I-priors. This includes multiple regression models, smoothing models, random effects models, and longitudinal models. Research into this area involve extending the I-prior methodology to generalised linear models (e.g. logistic regression), Structural Equation Models (SEM), and models with structured error covariances.","tags":["I-prior","PhD"],"title":"Regression Modelling using I-Priors","type":"event"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
