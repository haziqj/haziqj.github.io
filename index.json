However, past studies have shown that students hold misconceptions about important statistical concepts. This present study aims to reconfirm past efforts in this area, specifically in a South East Asian higher education institution. To test how well undergraduate university students' understood key concepts in hypothesis testing, an online multiple choice questionnaire was deployed. The questionnaire also asked for students' confidence ratings for each question, allowing us to distinguish the confident versus non-confident incorrect responses. A follow-up interview was then conducted to give deeper insights into reasons behind respondents' errors. The main finding is that there are significantly more confident wrong answers than non-confident ones -- highly indicative of the presence of misconceptions among respondents. Among them, students firmly believed that statistical inference procedures provide a direct calculational proof of the null hypothesis. Additionally, students have difficulty formulating correct hypotheses to be tested, and have poor grasp of the role of signficance levels in hypothesis testing. Whether or not students were taking a quantitative-focused programme, or had prior statistics training, had no bearing on their survey score. Despite this, confidence ratings were significantly higher in both groups.","tags":[],"title":"I think I understand: Investigating misconceptions regarding hypothesis test concepts among university students","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil","Huda M.

Much like the society in those days, where there was a wary public feeling about the rigidness of the mathematical instruction in Pythagoras' school, mathematics educators find themselves in a similar position in the common era of 2020. Unlike the Ancient Greece however, the battle is for the sustained delivery of a comprehensive mathematics education in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. It would be fair to say that mathematics departments across all levels of the education sector have been affected drastically; more so on instructors who favour the traditional \"chalk and talk\" method of instruction. In this article, we share several lessons learned in the delivery of mathematical instruction at undergraduate university level during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on our experience at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. These include specific methods for implementing online learning effectively, the pros and cons of such methods, and how we can use computer based tools to make learning more conducive. We highly think that these implementations are beneficial to be adapted by mathematics departments anywhere as a means of adapting to the new realities post Covid-19.","tags":["Automated assessments","Blended learning","Dynamic exercises","Learning management systems"],"title":"Advocating Blended Learning for University Undergraduate Level Mathematical Instruction Beyond Covid-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Myrsini Katsikatsou","Irini Moustaki","Haziq Jamil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630943568,"objectID":"0b0af8c523f64c5ef00ea11a3fe79ba3","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/publication/katsikatsou-pairwise-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T14:10:51.180368Z","relpermalink":"/publication/katsikatsou-pairwise-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Methods for the treatment of item non-response in attitudinal scales and in large-scale assessments under the pairwise likelihood (PL) estimation framework and under a missing at random (MAR) mechanism are proposed.

However, this is not the case for pseudo-likelihood approaches such as the PL. We develop and study the performance of three strategies for incorporating missing values into confirmatory factor analysis under the PL framework, the complete-pairs (CP), the available-cases (AC) and the doubly robust (DR) approaches. The CP and AC require only a model for the observed data and standard errors are easy to compute. Doubly-robust versions of the PL estimation require a predictive model for the missing responses given the observed ones and are computationally more demanding than the AC and CP. A simulation study is used to compare the proposed methods.

However, in schistosomiasis diagnostic studies, several inherent study design issues pose a real challenge for the currently available statistical tools used for diagnostic modelling and associated data analysis and conclusions. More specifically, those study design issues are:\n the inclusion of small number of diagnostic tests (i.e. most often five), non formal consensus about a schistosomiasis gold standard, the contemporary use of relatively small sample sizes in relevant studies due to lack of research funding, the differing levels of prevalence of the studied disease even within the same area of one endemic country and other real world factors such as: the lack of appropriate equipment, the variability of certain methods due to biological phenomena and training of technicians across the endemic countries because of scarce financial resources contributing to the existing lack of a schistosomiasis gold standard. The current study aims to caution practitioners from blindly applying statistical models with small number of diagnostic tests and sample sizes, proposing design guidelines of future schistosomiasis diagnostic accuracy studies with recommendations for further research. While our study is centred around the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, we feel that the recommendations can be adapted to other major tropical infectious diseases as well.

Schistosomiasis is a highly debilitating tropical infectious disease with severe burden of morbidity and thus operational research accurately evaluating diagnostics that quantify the epidemic status for guiding effective strategies is essential. Latent class models (LCMs) have been generally considered in epidemiology and in particular in recent schistosomiasis diagnostic studies as a flexible tool for evaluating diagnostics because assessing the true infection status (via a gold standard) is not possible. However, within the biostatistics literature, classical LCM have already been criticised for real-life problems under violation of the conditional independence (CI) assumption and when applied to a small number of diagnostics (i.e. most often 3-5 diagnostic tests). Solutions of relaxing the CI assumption and accounting for zero-inflation, as well as collecting partial gold standard information, have been proposed, offering the potential for more robust model estimates. In the current article, we examined such approaches in the context of schistosomiasis via analysis of two real datasets and extensive simulation studies. Our main conclusions highlighted poor model fit in low prevalence settings and the necessity of collecting partial gold standard information in such settings in order to improve the accuracy and reduce bias of sensitivity and specificity estimates.","tags":["Latent Class Models"],"title":"Latent Class Analysis: Insights about design and analysis of schistosomiasis diagnostic studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"Links  An interactive visualisation of Bayesian inference MCMC demo  References  Bollen, K.

If we specify a \"good\" prior, in the sense that the prior nudges the likelihood in the right direction, then the estimates will also be good. This is what we aim to do in the case of variable selection problems, whereby the Bayesian method reduces the selection problem to one of estimation from a true search of the variable space for the model which optimises a certain criterion. We contribute to the vastly available literature of variable selection methods by using I-priors [(Bergsma, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosta.2019.10.002)---a class of Gaussian distributions which has the distinguishing property of having covariance proportional to the Fisher information (of the model parameters). The original motivation behind the I-prior methodology was to develop a novel unifying approach to various regression models. In this work, we detail the I-prior model used, and showcase some simulation results and several real-world applications in which the I-prior performs favourably compared to other prior distributions and/or variable selection techniques in terms of model size, $R^2$, predictive ability, and so on.","tags":["Bayesian","Collinearity","Linear regression","MCMC","Variable selection"],"title":"Bayesian Variable Selection for Linear Models Using I-Priors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wicher Bergsma","Haziq Jamil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630943568,"objectID":"3a07da07eaf0581dae090bf0b3377086","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/publication/bergsma-regression-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T14:10:51.03903Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bergsma-regression-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce the I-prior methodology as a unifying framework for estimating a variety of regression models, including varying coefficient, multilevel, longitudinal models, and models with functional covariates and responses. It can also be used for multi-class classification, with low or high dimensional covariates. The I-prior is generally defined as a maximum entropy prior. For a regression function, the I-prior is Gaussian with covariance kernel proportional to the Fisher information on the regression function, which is estimated by its posterior distribution under the I-prior. The I-prior has the intuitively appealing property that the more information is available on a linear functional of the regression function, the larger the prior variance, and the smaller the influence of the prior mean on the posterior distribution. Advantages compared to competing methods, such as Gaussian process regression or Tikhonov regularization, are ease of estimation and model comparison. In particular, we develop an EM algorithm with a simple E and M step for estimating hyperparameters, facilitating estimation for complex models. We also propose a novel parsimonious model formulation, requiring a single scale parameter for each (possibly multidimensional) covariate and no further parameters for interaction effects. This simplifies estimation because fewer hyperparameters need to be estimated, and also simplifies model comparison of models with the same covariates but different interaction effects; in this case, the model with the highest estimated likelihood can be selected. Using a number of widely analyzed real data sets we show that predictive performance of our methodology is competitive.

For instance, calculating the likelihood of such models require marginalising over the latent variables, and this may prove to be difficult computationally, either due to dimensionality or model design. Variational inference, or variational Bayes as it is also known, offers an efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the Laplace approximation, and quadrature methods. Rooted in Bayesian inference and popularised in machine learning, the main idea is to overcome the difficulties faced by working with “easy” density functions in lieu of the true posterior distribution.

In this thesis, we explore a novel methodology for fitting a wide range of parametric and nonparametric regression models, called the I-prior methodology [(Bergsma, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosta.2019.10.002).\n\nWe assume that the regression function belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert or Kreĭn space of functions, and by doing so, allows us to utilise the convenient topologies of these vector spaces. This is important for the derivation of the Fisher information of the regression function, which might be infinite dimensional. Based on the principle of maximum entropy, an I-prior is an objective Gaussian process prior for the regression function with covariance function proportional to its Fisher information.\n\nOur work focusses on the statistical methodology and computational aspects of fitting I-priors models. We examine a likelihood-based approach (direct optimisation and EM algorithm) for fitting I-prior models with normally distributed errors. The culmination of this work is the `R` package [`iprior`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=iprior) which has been made publicly available on CRAN. The normal I-prior methodology is subsequently extended to fit categorical response models, achieved by ''squashing'' the regression functions through a probit sigmoid function. Estimation of I-probit models, as we call it, proves challenging due to the intractable integral involved in computing the likelihood. We overcome this difficulty by way of variational approximations. Finally, we turn to a fully Bayesian approach of variable selection using I-priors for linear models to tackle multicollinearity.\n\nWe illustrate the use of I-priors in various simulated and real-data examples. Our study advocates the I-prior methodology as being a simple, intuitive, and comparable alternative to similar leading state-of-the-art models.\n","tags":[],"title":"Regression modelling using priors depending on Fisher information covariance kernels (I-priors)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":153576e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630943568,"objectID":"098d2bd5e0f399d42eef95c1c4c918b2","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/r-iprobit/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/r-iprobit/","section":"project","summary":"Binary and multinomial probit regression using I-priors in `R`.","tags":["PhD","R Package","Probit Models"],"title":"R/iprobit","type":"project"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"Spatio-temporal modelling of bovine tuberculosis Prediction of probability surface plots over time.\n   ","date":1522153800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630943568,"objectID":"d0b440a5660c53de285635aed83f24ad","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/talk/binary-and-multinomial-regression-using-fisher-information-covariance-kernels-i-priors/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/binary-and-multinomial-regression-using-fisher-information-covariance-kernels-i-priors/","section":"event","summary":"In a regression setting, we define an I-prior as a Gaussian process prior on the regression function with covariance kernel equal to its Fisher information. We present some methodology and computational work on estimating regression functions by working in the appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions and assuming an I-prior on the function of interest. In a regression model with normally distributed errors, estimation is simple—maximum likelihood and the EM algorithm is employed. In the classification models (categorical response models), estimation is performed using variational inference. I-prior models perform comparatively well, and often better, to similar leading state-of-the-art models for use in prediction and inference. Applications are plentiful, including smoothing models, modelling multilevel data, longitudinal data, functional covariates, multi-class classification, and even spatiotemporal modelling.","tags":["I-prior","PhD","Spatio-temporal","Probit Models"],"title":"Binary and Multinomial Regression using Fisher Information Covariance Kernels (I-priors)","type":"event"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517488200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630943568,"objectID":"5cbd844c7ec464af0a443cda35bae168","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/talk/a-beginners-guide-to-variational-inference/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a-beginners-guide-to-variational-inference/","section":"event","summary":"Estimation of complex models that consists of latent variables and various parameters, in addition to the data that is observed, might involve overcoming an intractable integral.

The regression function is estimated by its posterior mean under the I-prior, and scale parameters are estimated via maximum marginal likelihood using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Regression modelling using I-priors has several attractive features: it requires no assumptions other than those pertaining to the model of interest; estimation and inference is relatively straightforward; and small and large sample performance can be better than Tikhonov regularization.

Switching over to a fully Bayesian framework, we now look at the problem of variable selection, specifically in an ordinary linear regression setting. The appeal of Bayesian methods are that it reduces the selection problem to one of estimation, rather than a true search of the variable space for the model that optimises a certain criterion.
