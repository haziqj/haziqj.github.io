For example, soldiers are expected to communicate effectively with each other, operate specialised equipment, and maintain overall situational awareness--often while carrying a heavy load. From a planning and doctrine perspective, it is important for commanders to understand the relationship between load carriage and soldiers’ performance. Such information could help provide recommendations in advising future policies on training, operational safety, and future soldier systems requirements. To this end, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF) conducted controlled experiments and collected numerous measurements intended to capture key soldier performance parameters. The structure of the data set provided several interesting challenges, namely 1) how do we define “performance”?; 2) how do we appropriately take into account the longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measurements)?; and 3) how do we handle non-ignorable dropouts? We propose a structural equation model to quantify a latent variable representing soldiers' abilities, while taking into consideration the non-random nature of the dropouts and time-varying effects. The main output of the study is to quantify the relationship between load carried versus performance. Additionally, modelling the dropouts allow us to also determine “expected time to exhaustion” for a given load carried by a soldier.","tags":["Latent Variable Models","Structural Equation Models"],"title":"Investigating the effect of load carriage on soldiers’ performances using structural equation models","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630935537,"objectID":"1cda19dd8843ec96b438455bdcdcd736","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/project/stat-tables/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stat-tables/","section":"project","summary":"An open source PDF format of statistical tables for use in examinations, tests, assignments, and so on.","tags":["Statistical Tables","Misc"],"title":"Statistical Tables","type":"project"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573653600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630935537,"objectID":"af988344b8d94a14a102df14b3a13841","permalink":"https://haziqj.github.io/talk/bayesian-variable-selection-for-linear-models/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bayesian-variable-selection-for-linear-models/","section":"event","summary":"In statistical modelling, there is often a genuine interest to learn the most reasonable, parsimonious, and interpretable model that fits the data.

The regression function is estimated by its posterior mean under the I-prior, and scale parameters are estimated via maximum marginal likelihood using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Regression modelling using I-priors has several attractive features: it requires no assumptions other than those pertaining to the model of interest; estimation and inference is relatively straightforward; and small and large sample performance can be better than Tikhonov regularization. We illustrate the use of the iprior package by analysing three well- known data sets, in particular, a multilevel data set, a longitudinal data set, and a dataset involving a functional covariate.","tags":["I-prior"],"title":"Regression Modelling with I-Priors","type":"event"},{"authors":["Haziq Jamil"],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Switching over to a fully Bayesian framework, we now look at the problem of variable selection, specifically in an ordinary linear regression setting. The appeal of Bayesian methods are that it reduces the selection problem to one of estimation, rather than a true search of the variable space for the model that optimises a certain criterion.
