&lt;p>Accurate schistosomiasis diagnosis is essential to assess the impact of large scale and repeated mass drug administration to control or even eliminate this disease.
However, in schistosomiasis diagnostic studies, several inherent study design issues pose a real challenge for the currently available statistical tools used for diagnostic modelling and associated data analysis and conclusions.
More specifically, those study design issues are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the inclusion of small number of diagnostic tests (i.e. most often five),&lt;/li>
&lt;li>non formal consensus about a schistosomiasis gold standard,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the contemporary use of relatively small sample sizes in relevant studies due to lack of research funding,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the differing levels of prevalence of the studied disease even within the same area of one endemic country and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>other real world factors such as: the lack of appropriate equipment, the variability of certain methods due to biological phenomena and training of technicians across the endemic countries because of scarce financial resources contributing to the existing lack of a schistosomiasis gold standard.
The current study aims to caution practitioners from blindly applying statistical models with small number of diagnostic tests and sample sizes, proposing design guidelines of future schistosomiasis diagnostic accuracy studies with recommendations for further research.
While our study is centred around the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, we feel that the recommendations can be adapted to other major tropical infectious diseases as well.&lt;/li>
